# DS-Capstone-Final

This repository includes files needed for my final project to complete the course HarvardX -  PH125.9x, Data Science: Capstone. The project uses various data sources and modeling techniques to build a county level predictive model to guess the death rate from COVID-19 (deaths / cases). The author is Becky Johnson.

The repository includes three data files that are called by the R and Rmd files - 

* census.gov - selected data from the American Community Survey 5-Year tables
* us-counties-recent.csv - COVID-19 cases and death rates by county published by the New York Times
* mask-use.csv - a survey of county level mask use published by the New York Times
* analytic_data2020_0.csv - county level health data from the county health rankings published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute

There are three other files in the repository - 

* DS-Capstone-Final.Rmd - the report with explanations in R Markdown format
* DS-Capstone-Final.R - the R script used to generate the dataset and analysis
* DS-Capstone-Final.pdf - the final report generated from the .Rmd file saved as a .pdf

Running the R script or knitting the Markdown file each take a few minutes to complete.

Configuration: This code was written using R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22). Libraries needed to run the code will download within the script.
